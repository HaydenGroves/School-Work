				Here are some tips you can use to save electricity and money:
				1. Switch Supplier or Tariff - an expensive tariff or supplier will cost you more if you choose not to look for a cheaper supplier.
				There are plenty of websites on the internet that can help you find cheaper energy suppliers and tariffs, such as moneysupermarket.com and switch.which.co.uk.
				These sites help you to find the cheapest supplier and offer you a variety of companies to choose from and they allow you to compare these suppliers to your current one.
		
				2. Check meters and heaters are set up properly - Make sure that your meters and heaters are set up properly so that you aren't wasting energy.
				For instance, if the heaters are on during the day when no one is home, you end up wasting energy.
				
				3. Making home improvements - making home improvments such as upgrading appliances to their green versions or installing improvements in your home such as
				new insulation or double glazed windows. smalls savings can build up and these improvements will save you a lot of money in the long run
				
				4. Invest into green solutions - although the initial cost will be high, installing green technology into your home such as solar panels or a biomass generator.
				by installing this techonology you lessen your reliance on the national grid, which makes your energy bills much cheaper. Not only do you lower your energy bills,
				but you can also sell excess electricity and you avoid being screwed over by price hikes from suppliers.
